        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The objective is to determine if music genre preferences shift according to the season. We are analyzing a dataset comparing five genres (Comedy, Electronic, Folk, Metal, Rock) across Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall to identify seasonal correlations.<br>

        <h3>Part 2: Chart Variables</h3>

        <text-icon icon="rightwards-arrow"></text-icon> Chart Type: Bar Chart.<br>
        <text-icon icon="rightwards-arrow"></text-icon> X-Axis: The various seasons.<br>
        <text-icon icon="rightwards-arrow"></text-icon> Y-Axis: The scaled listening value.<br>
        <text-icon icon="rightwards-arrow"></text-icon> Visualization: Colours are used to divide and

represent the various genres.

 &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

        <h3><br>Result: What the Data Actually Shows</h3>
        <b>Winter:</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Dominated by Metal (1).
 &nbsp;Rock &amp; Alternative is the only other significant genre visible (0.35).<br>
        <br><b>Spring:</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Folk takes the lead (1), closely followed by Metal (0.88). Electronic appears moderately (0.39).<br>
        <br><b>Summer:</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Surprisingly, Comedy / Novelty and Electronic spikes to the top spot (1).<br>
        <br><b>Fall:</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Rock reaches peak popularity (1). Electronic rebounds strongly (0.89), while Comedy retains some popularity (0.4).<br>
        <br>

        <h3>Discussion: Analysis and Hypotheses</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Distinct genres dominate in different seasons (Metal in Winter, Rock in Fall, Folk in Spring, Comedy in Summer).<span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"> The results show a clear contrast in mood: the high concentration on core genres (Rock/Metal) in Winter suggests a preference for familiar music, while the massive spike in Comedy/Novelty in Summer challenges the idea of continuous musical listening during the holiday season, pointing instead towards a preference for lighthearted or spoken-word entertainment.</span><br>

        <h3><br>Extra: Additional Information</h3>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The "Summer of Fun" Anomaly:<br>
The massive spike in Comedy/Novelty and Electronic during Summer suggests a seasonal preference for lighthearted entertainment or spoken word content during holidays, contrasting sharply with the serious tone of Winter.<br>
        <text-icon icon="rightwards-arrow"></text-icon>Electronic's Peak:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Electronic &amp; Dance performs well in most seasons but struggles in the extreme season of Winter.<br>
        <text-icon icon="rightwards-arrow"></text-icon>Winter Minimalism:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Winter shows the least variety in genres, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; suggesting listeners stick to a narrower range of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; favorites (primarily Rock) during the colder months.<br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <div>&nbsp; &nbsp; We can thus see that Summer is the season with the most amount of different music genres, possibly due to the various music festivals that promote more than a singular genre.<br>
