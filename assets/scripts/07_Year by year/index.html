&nbsp; &nbsp; This Area Chart answers the question:<br>“How does genre trend change in time?"<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Our objective is to determine how music popularity, measured by Top 100 presence, has evolved from 1960 to 2025, revealing the rise and decline of various musical genres throughout the years.<br>
<br>
<br>
<p></p><h3>Part 1: Chart Variables</h3>

<br>

<text-icon icon="rightwards-arrow"></text-icon> Chart Type: Area Chart.<br>
<text-icon icon="rightwards-arrow"></text-icon> X-Axis: The Years.<br>
<text-icon icon="rightwards-arrow"></text-icon> Y-Axis: The listening value.<br>
<text-icon icon="rightwards-arrow"></text-icon> Visualization: Colours are used to divide and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; represent the various genres.<br>
<br>

<h3><br>Result: What the Data Actually Shows</h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; Rock &amp; Alternative dominated for over three decades before declining after 1986.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hip-hop &amp; Rap surged in popularity after 1988, shaping modern music trends.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Italian Disco &amp; Dance has various peaks such as in 1988 and 2009 but hasn’t been relevant in the top 100 since 2015.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Holiday &amp; Seasonal is relevant every year but has various peaks as expected due to the very seasonal nature of the music itself, with it having a “Expiration Date” on when it should be listened to<br>
<br>


<h3>Discussion: Analysis and Hypotheses</h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; The shifts in genre popularity often correlate with external factors.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; The sudden popularity of African contemporary and diaspora music can be attributed to the virality of songs like 'Love Nwantiti' and 'Calm Down' on social media platforms like TikTok, which included these songs in viral challenges and dance videos.&nbsp;<br>This can also be thanks to the ever-increasing ability for consumers to find new genres and explore outside their own bubble of music tastes, due to the expansion of music streaming.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
We can also find an interesting case where as Jazz and blues tend to be replaced by Hip-Hop and Rap almost entirely. This is due to the evolution of Jazz and Blues, which gave birth to a lot of new genres such as Reggaeand Hip-Hop itself. Whilst Hip-Hop became <b>predominantly</b> commercial music, Jazz and Blues became more fragmented and niche with their sound.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Another interesting case is Electronic &amp; Dance, which has seen both periods of relevance and ambiguity.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
In the 1990s, we can find a completely different landscape in respect to the 2010s, with 90s Electronic having a more Underground House/Techno feel thanks to artists such as The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, or Daft Punk, breeding innovation in the genre.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Meanwhile, the 2010s leaned more towards EDM with artists such as Avicii, Skrillex, David Guetta, Martin Garrix, and Swedish House Mafia. This subgenre of Electronic &amp; Dance music had a much wider reach due to its adaptation of existing genres and having a greater focus on the <b>vocal</b> aspect of the track, in respect to the 90s-style Electronic music. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul>
